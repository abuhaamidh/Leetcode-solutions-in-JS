//To find the length of the last word, 
  First trim(), this is to remove the extra spaces around the string
  Then we can use split() to convert the string into words, so that we can easily find the length of a particular word
  And to find the last word we can use length -1 and .length to find the length of the current word.


var lengthOfLastWord = function(s) {
  var wordSplit = s.trim().split(" ");
  var lastWord =  wordSplit[wordSplit.length-1]
  return lastWord.length
   
};
