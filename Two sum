// Simplest solution for Two Sum which is very basic and most commonly asked in interviews.
So here in this code what it does is:
  It iterates the whole array two times with i and j
  And if the values of i and j which is nums[i] + nums[j] == target
  It returns the nums which is only the values not the index

var twoSum = function(nums, target) {
    for(let i=0; i< nums.length; i++){
        for(let j=i+1; j< nums.length; j++){
            if(nums[j] + nums[i] == target ){
                return [i,j];
            }
        }
    }
    return nums;
};
