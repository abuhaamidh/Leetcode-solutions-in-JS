//This is to find the the occurences of an unique numbers using hashing
Hashing is nothing more than we can call it as an index of a book, It helps easy finding a chapter among 50 without searching each and every pages.

for(let num of arr){ // iterating over arr
if(store.has(num)){   // If store has the num from arr

}else{
store.set(num, 1) //else it sets the value as default as one
 }
}
let occurences = Array.from(store.values()); //Here the count will be in key value pair, so we are just taking only values(count) in an array 
let uniqueValue = new Set(occurences); //Now we are creating a new Set for occurences, this Set automatically removes duplicate and gives only the unique value

return occurences.length === uniqueValue.size ? true : false //If the length of currentcount and uniquevalue of occurences are equal it returns true or returns false
